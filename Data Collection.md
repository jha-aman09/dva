ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A retail store monitors customer movement to optimize shelf placement.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Eliminates response bias.  
- Captures real-time behaviors.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Interpretation can be subjective.  
- Cannot capture reasons behind behaviors.  

---

### **d) Experiments**  
Experiments involve manipulating variables **in a controlled environment** to measure their impact.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A company tests two different website designs (A/B testing) to determine which one leads to more sales.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Helps establish cause-and-effect relationships.  
- Provides high accuracy in controlled conditions.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Can be costly and time-consuming.  
- Artificial settings may not reflect real-world conditions.  

---

### **e) Focus Groups**  
A focus group consists of a **small group of people (6â€“12)** discussing a particular topic under the guidance of a moderator.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A smartphone company organizes a focus group to understand customer opinions on a new product.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Provides diverse opinions and deeper insights.  
- Useful for exploratory research.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Results may not be generalizable.  
- One dominant participant may influence others' responses.

## **2. Secondary Data Collection Methods**  
Secondary data is **already collected and available** from various sources. It is **cheaper and quicker** to obtain but may not always be relevant or up-to-date.  

### **a) Government & Public Records**  
Government agencies publish data on **population, economic indicators, health, and employment**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A researcher uses Census Bureau data for demographic analysis.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Reliable and credible sources.  
- Large datasets available for free.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Data may be outdated.  
- Limited control over how data was originally collected.  

---

### **b) Company Reports & Internal Databases**  
Organizations maintain **historical sales data, financial reports, and customer information**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A bank uses past loan approval records to train a predictive credit risk model.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Directly relevant to business needs.  
- Usually high quality and structured.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- May not be accessible to external researchers.  
- Data privacy and security concerns.  

---

### **c) Research Papers & Academic Journals**  
Researchers use **previous studies and scholarly articles** for their analysis.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A scientist reviews past medical studies before conducting new drug research.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Provides validated, peer-reviewed data.  
- Helps in building theoretical foundations.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- May not be applicable to current market conditions.  
- Some journals require paid access.  

---

### **d) Web Scraping & Online Data Sources**  
Data is extracted from **websites, social media, and online platforms** using automated tools.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A company scrapes Twitter data to analyze public sentiment about a product.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Real-time and diverse data availability.  
- Useful for competitive analysis.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Legal and ethical concerns.  
- Data may contain noise and irrelevant information.  

---

### **e) Big Data & IoT Devices**  
Sensors, smart devices, and connected systems generate massive amounts of **real-time data**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:** A smart city project collects traffic data from IoT sensors to optimize road signals.  

ðŸ”¹ **Advantages:**  
- Provides real-time insights.  
- Captures massive datasets.  

ðŸ”¹ **Disadvantages:**  
- Requires advanced infrastructure and storage.
